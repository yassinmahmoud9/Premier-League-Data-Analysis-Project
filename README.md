Methods
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Missing values were handled, and data types were standardized.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical summaries and visualizations were used to understand the data distribution and initial patterns.
Analysis by Category: Each question was addressed using specific visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts).
Combined Insights: Analysis was consolidated across categories to identify overarching patterns.
Insights and Findings
Nationality and Age Trends: Identified the most common nationalities among players, with insights into average age and height variations by nationality.
Performance by Position: Certain positions (e.g., forwards) showed higher averages in goals and assists, while defenders led in interceptions.
Salary and Performance Correlation: Salary patterns were evident by position and club, and certain performance metrics were correlated with higher salaries.

Results
A dashboard was created to visualize top players by performance metrics, including goals, assists, and salary distribution. The report summary and insights into age-performance correlations, salary trends, and team performance are provided in detail in the report.pdf file.
